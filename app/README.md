# Introduction
When I was watching a YouTube video, I heard a song that was on SoundCloud. But the song name was not mentioned in the description or comments. So than I tried to find the song with Shazam, but it was no use. I could not find it with Shazam, so then I searched for an alternative online. But there was no alternative, so that's when I decided to make my own app to solve this problem.

This project was made for a test application that can be used to detect SoundCloud songs using the microphone of the phone.
Currently, the application is only tested for Android, if someone with a Mac wants to test the project and make iOS work I would really appreciate that. You can then open a PR and I will review it.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:
```bash
# install npm packages
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```
```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
